        For my PhD I modelled tumour growth. To do this I first numerically solved a system of partial differential equations, and then performed a significant amount of Mathematics analysis on the system of equations as well as the numerical solutions. This was a Mathematics PhD, but involved approximately 50% programming.
        I was engaged in independent (supervised) research, including Mathematical analysis,
        scientific programming, and producing literature (a <a href="docs/Eyles_King_Styles_paper.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> (arxiv link <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06590" target="_blank">here</a>) and a <a href="docs/Thesis_Joe_Eyles_2019.pdf" target="_blank">thesis</a> (link to the publication <a href="http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/84803/" target="_blank">here</a>)). I was also involved in teaching undergraduate students, and marking work.
        The system of equations I numerically solved and analysed is shown below, along with a diagram detailing the notation for the interior and exterior of the tumour.

        Since I wanted to use a sharp interface approach and finite element methods, I had to maintain an evolving mesh on this moving boundary. This is a highly complex problem, that has no standard solution. In order to generate a solution, I had to implement a number of algorithms from the literature.
        I settled on a combination of approaches. The first approach smooths the velocity of the boundary over the interior of the tumour, allowing the mesh to evolve with it. The second re-builds the mesh when it reaches a point at which it can no longer be smoothed. You can see this below.

        Eye tracking
      </h3>

      <p class="spacing_top_2_5">
        In the past I have worked with a robotics research group at the University of Portsmouth. I was researching eye tracking methods (finding the eyes in an image of a face, or a webcam feed). I then used this to aproximate the gaze location on a computer screen. I programmed in both C++ and Matlab to create my own method, which was as effective as many of the existing methods.
        We published a paper to an IEEE journal. Go to <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6722242/" target="_blank">here</a> for the paper. For more information see the informal <a href="http://joescomputingfun.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> that I wrote during the work.
