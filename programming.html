      <p>
        From June 2013 until September 2014 I worked at <a href="https://matchboxmobile.com/" target="_blank">Matchbox Mobile</a> as a Junior developer. During that time I worked on a number of projects, including building a system to auto-generate loyalty card apps for small businesses. These ran on Android, iOS, and Windows Phones, and were all written in C# using Xamarin. You can find the apps
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Matchbox%20Mobile&hl=en" target="_blank">here</a>.

              <b>Curve planetoid:</b> an Android game in which you pit your 3D thinking skills against this space distorting game. Aim and curve your shots over planetoid surfaces to hit the target. This app makes a folded 2D surface resting in 3D space out of a triangular mesh. Player and target positions are shown, and the player can shoot in any direction. The curving shot wraps around the surface (creating a geodesic route), and possibly hits the target!
              You can find a paid version <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ambientqueststudios.curveplanetoid.android" target="_blank">here</a>, and a free version

              <b>Cubic Interpolator:</b> this game originates with me doing some idle maths in order to join a number of points together with a smooth curve. I solved it first with a series of quadratic functions, but the result tended to oscillate wildly. I then solved it with a series of cubic functions, constraining the turning points to be on the points. This created a much smoother effect, and inspired me to begin creating this simple side scrolling game. You fly a space ship through zones killing enemies and collecting powerups. The zones are randomly generated, but deterministic, and your current zone is saved between plays. Here the interface is native to android, but the game itself runs on a html5 canvas in a WebView.
